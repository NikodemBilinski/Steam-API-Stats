# Steam API statistics .NET website

For it to work you have to input your own Steam Api Key
I could just put there my own but its not safe, I've heard before about some scams that used leaked Api Keys so yk

1. Go to this website https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.

2. Log in and generate the key.

3. Also the steam profile that you're checking out here must be public.
